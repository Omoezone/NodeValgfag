    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Express and the terminal</h1>
    <pre style="text-align: center;">We will on this page demonstrate how we work with the <i>terminal</i>
as we use the different tools in our toolbelts, such as <b>git commands</b> and <b>npm</b>.
Then will we look at <i>express</i> and how we ready an <i>express</i> projects.</pre><br>

<h1 id="express" style="text-align: center;"><u>Express</u></h1><br>
<div style="margin: auto; width:75%; display:flex;">
    <pre>Before we cant begin the work with our <i>NodeJS</i> programs, we might want to install and use <i>express</i>. 
        <dl>
            <dt>1. Create a project folder</dt>
            <dd>You simply need to make a folder, which we can then use in a workspace. When we are working with express, would we want to 
make a Javascript file called <i>app.js</i> (standard) and a JSON file called <i>package.json</i> to create dependencies.</dd>
            <dt>2. Create a package.json file (create dependencies)</dt>
            <dd>Create a new file and name it (name).json. Then we new to ensure that we actually make it a Json by using the "{}". 
We are now ready to declare the <i>dependencies</i> for the project. When we do that, should we remember to think "key & values". 
First we need the key which is <i>"dependencies":</i> and the value is what is inside the "{}". Inside of those, will we have a new key & value pair. 
As we are wanting to work with express, will the next key be <i>"express":</i> and the value will be the version of the key (express) we will be running. 
So the final result would be:
{
    "dependencies": {
        "express": "^4.17.1"
    }
}
We can then add more <i>dependencies</i> inside of the tags in the key & value format.</dd>
            <dt>3. Install express for our project with <i>npm install</i></dt>
            <dd>We have now made the dependencies for our <i>NodeJS</i> project but we have not yet installed express for our project, which we will do now.
For that would we need to use <i>npm</i>(Node Package Manager) to install express. We do that by a terminal command called <i>npm install</i> or just <i>npm i</i>.
This command looks in our created <i>package.json</i> file and install the dependencies that we have defined, which in this case is only <i>express</i>. 
This command should be the first thing you do, when you recieve a NodeJS program from another person, to ensure that you run the program with the correct dependencies.
<!--INSERT PICTURE OF COMMAND LINE HERE--></dd>
            <dt>4. Tell NodeJS that we want to use express (require)</dt>
            <dd>As we have now installed express and other eventual dependencies, will we now have to "tell" our <i>app.js</i> (Node program) that we want to use express.
We do this by first importing the express module (that we just installed) from our newly generated <i>node_modules</i> folder, with the <i>require</i> funtion.
How we do this, is showned here: 
        <b>const</b> express = require('express');
        <b>const</b> app = express();

We create and constant called <i>express</i> which we then use to hold the express module.
Then we create a new constant called app, which would be the constant we use to create our callbacks.    </dd>
            <dt>5. Create a listen callback</dt>
            <dd>The last step we need to do before we can use our program. We need to define how the program communicates. 
We do this with the <i>listen</i> function which we call on our app constant, we just created. 
The <i>listen</i> function will be a callback, that takes the port we run the program on and optionally an error. It is this function that enable us to run the program. 
A good practise would be to tell the user that the program is running and at what port in the console. Example: 

        app.listen(8080, (error) => {
            if(error){
                console.log("The program experienced an error" + error);
            }else {
                console.log("Starting program on port: ", 8080);
            }
        });</dd>
        </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Git commands</dt>
        <dd>When we are coding and working with IDE's, will we often use github as a file manager and sharing tool. 
To do this will we need understand the different commands we have to use. we do this in a few steps.
All steps need to begin with keyword "git".
1. We need to save the files that we need to be sent to github.                  
    <b>> git add -A</b> (The "A" says 'save everything in the project'. it can be more specifik too)
2. We need to pack the files in a commit that is ready to be sent to our github. 
    <b>> git commit -m "<i>Here we put commit message</i>"</b>
3. We then need to send the files to our github and finalize the commit, with a push. 
    <b>> git push</b></dd>
        <dt>Node & Nodemon</dt>
        <dd>Node and nodemon is terminal commands that we use to run our program in its current state. 
It is these commands that trigger the <i>listen</i> function in our program. 
The <b>node</b> command runs the program once, while <b>nodemon</b> keeps restarting the program each time we change something i our project.
Node is preinstalled and a part of the basic nodeJS framework, where we need to install <b>nodemon</b> ourself with a <b>npm</b> command. 

Usage: 
We call either <b>node</b> or <b>nodemon</b> on the file we want to run. We made an file called <i>app.js</i> earlier which we
now want to run with the help of the terminal. We ensure that we are on the correct path (the folder where we saved <i>app.js</i>).
Then we simply write either <b>node</b> or <b>nodemon</b> followed by the name of the file we want to run, like this:
    <b>> PS C:\Users\xxx\xxx\NodeJS\NodeValgfag\Mandatory\Mandatory1> nodemon.cmd app.js</b>
    or
    <b>> PS C:\Users\xxx\xxx\NodeJS\NodeValgfag\Mandatory\Mandatory1> node app.js</b>
We will sometimes have to put <i>.cmd</i> after node or nodemon to be able to use it. That is a path problem which is easily fixed this way. </dd>
        <dt>npm</dt>
        <dd>npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for javascript. It is an online database of packages, that we
(the users) can access and use. This online database is called the <b>npm registry</b>. We access the npm registry with our client in the terminal
and install the given packages we need and/or want. We can find all sorts of different packages on the npm website. </dd>
