            <!--<h6>For recommendations: <b>**INSERT NUMBER AND NAME</b>--></h6>This was a job I had while studying as a way to earn some spending money.
            I worked in a position that required a lot of customer interraction, which gave me the social and talking skills I have now.
            I too was given the responsibility of openning and closening the shop aswel as managing an under 18 year old employee, days where
            the owner was out. That gave me experience in responsibility and management as I use as a part of my toolkit to this day. </pre></p>
