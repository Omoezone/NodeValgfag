mysql: 
----------
great for data that needs to aher to a rigid schema, structured data. 
great for when the requirements are not prone to change

mongoDB: 
----------
flexible -> rapid prototyping
great for javascript as a mongo object is close to an js object
puts a lot of pressure on the developer being good
